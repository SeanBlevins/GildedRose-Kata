# GuildedRose Katas

Here is some work I have done on the GuildedRose Katas

New items can be added by extending the `CategorizedItem` class.
The `categorizeItems()` method in the `Util` class would also need to be updated to check for the new item class.

Tests to check the solution can either e run from the command line with

`mvn test`

or simply open this project with
an IDE and run tests through the GUI.
